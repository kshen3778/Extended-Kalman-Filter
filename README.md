# Extended Kalman Filter Project

An implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter from Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree.\
Important concepts and code sections are commented and explained in the code.\


**FusionEKF.cpp**: Handles the initialization, time tracking, and calls Predict and Update functions.\
**kalman_filter.cpp**: Contains Predict and Update functions with Kalman Filter equations.\
**tools.cpp**: Contain functions for calculating RMSE (to evaluate performance) and calculating Jacobian Matrix (for EKF Update step).\
